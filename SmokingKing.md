# Travis

## Pre-fight dialogue

Travis: Is this... One of those legendary public baths?

Smoking King: Yeah, it's my own communal bath. Isn't the view amazing?

Travis: Bitchin' scenery, man. It's like I've got the world in my hands.

Smoking King: Luxury, greed, and riches have limits. This bath is sort of a farewell to all of that.

Travis: Nice line reading there. Like a famous quote or something.

Smoking King: Listen, racer. Standing on the borderline itself is how you feel the world of true speed.

Smoking King: If you're not standing on that line, then you're no racer - just some guy.

Travis: Hold up... I can't fight a racer.

Smoking King: Don't misunderstand, tough guy. From here on out, I'm a bodyguard.

Travis: Whose bodyguard?

Smoking King: The champion. Smoking King's bodyguard.

Travis: Sure, that'll do. Let's go, champ!

## Mid-fight dialogue

Smoking King: Tough guy... That's some impressive power.

Travis: You're pretty impressive yourself. Looks like you're the tough guy.

Smoking King: But the real battle begins now!

## Post-fight dialogue

Smoking King: I've lost... What a disappointment...

Travis: You're not a bad guy, champ. You're not built for killing.

Travis: You're a good and honest man. That's why you're respected.

Smoking King: I am not a good man. I'm full of greed and avarice.

Travis: Usually, a boss battle is full of all kinds of unfair tricks and attacks.

Travis: But your attacks are full of holes. Fight clean and fair, and you'll lose. That's the code of the underground.

Smoking King: I see... I guess it's time to turn a new leaf. Thank, tough guy.

Travis: Hold up, champ. The world is waiting for you.

Travis: Someday the GDGP will get a sequel. Until then, you gotta keep being the champ, you know?

Smoking King: I'm afraid I've reached my limit.

Travis: Try racing one more time, then decide whether or not that's true. It's not like you're running out of time.

Smoking King: Travis Touchdown... You've got a ways to go as a racer, but you're a true tough guy.

Smoking King: Someday, when we meet again...

Travis: Let's ride!

Smoking King: I'll go easy on you next time, too. Goodbye, tough guy.

White Sheepman: In the world of real men, the realest of men rise up from nothing.

White Sheepman: I'll be looking forward to watching you two realest of men, interlocked in your dance of death once again.

# Badman

## Pre-fight dialogue

Badman: This place... So this is where we're gonna do it?

Smoking King: Yeah, it's my own communal bath. Isn't the view amazing?

Badman: Nice scenery. Like I got the world in my hands.

Smoking King: Luxury, greed, and riches have limits. This bath is sort of a farewell to all of that.

Badman: I got no idea what that means. But it sounds lovely.

Smoking King: Listen, racer. Standing on the borderline itself is how you feel the world of true speed.

Smoking King: If you're not standing on that line, then you're no racer - just some guy.

Badman: Hold on... Fighting a racer doesn't mean this is a racing game, does it?

Smoking King: Don't misunderstand, tough guy. From here on out, I'm a bodyguard.

Badman: Whose bodyguard?

Smoking King: The champion. Smoking King's bodyguard.

Badman: Sure, that makes sense. Now bring it on, champ!

## Mid-fight dialogue

Smoking King: Tough guy... That's some impressive power.

Badman: You're not so bad yourself. I see you're a tough guy, too.

Smoking King: But the real battle begins now!

## Post-fight dialogue

Smoking King: I've lost... What a disappointment...

Badman: You're not a bad guy, champ. Killing isn't for you.

Badman: You're a good man. That's why you're respected.

Smoking King: I am not a good man. I'm full of greed and avarice.

Badman: If that's true, then you would've cheated.

Badman: But your attacks are full of holes. Fair play will get you killed. Them's the rules of the underground.

Smoking King: I see... I guess it's time to turn a new leaf. Thank, tough guy.

Badman: Wait, champ. The world is waiting for you.

Badman: Someday, GDGP will get a sequel. You gotta stay champ till then, right?

Smoking King: I'm afraid I've reached my limit.

Badman: Try racing one more time, then decide whether that's the case. It's not like you're running out of time.

Smoking King: Badman... You've got a ways to go as a racer, but you're a true tough guy.

Smoking King: Someday, when we meet again...

Badman: Yeah - let's ride.

Smoking King: I'll go easy on you next time, too. Goodbye, tough guy.

White Sheepman: In the world of real men, the realest of men rise up from nothing.

White Sheepman: I'll be looking forward to watching you two realest of men, interlocked in your dance of death once again.

# Shinobu

## Pre-fight dialogue

Shinobu: What a lovely location.

Smoking King: Yeah, it's my own communal bath. Isn't the view amazing?

Shinobu: It's really something. Can I Insta this?

Smoking King: Luxury, greed, and riches have limits. This bath is sort of a farewell to all of that.

Shinobu: Seriously, WTF...

Smoking King: Listen, racer. Standing on the borderline itself is how you feel the world of true speed.

Smoking King: If you're not standing on that line, then you're no racer - just some random.

Shinobu: No idea what you're talking about...

Smoking King: Don't misunderstand, tough girl. From here on out, I'm a bodyguard.

Shinobu: Bodyguard?

Smoking King: The champion. Smoking King's bodyguard.

Shinobu: Plenty of opponents to take on, I guess.

## Mid-fight dialogue

Smoking King: Tough girl... That's some impressive power.

Shinobu: You're not bad yourself, sumo!

Smoking King: But the real battle begins now!

## Post-fight dialogue

Smoking King: I've lost... What a disappointment...

Shinobu: I cannot kill a sumo. You're not one of "us."

Smoking King: I am not a good man. I'm full of greed and avarice.

Shinobu: Even with all those holes in your attacks, I still couldn't beat you in the sumo ring.

Smoking King: I see... I guess it's time to turn a new leaf. Thank, tough girl.

Shinobu: Why? You're still more than tough enough for a sumo wrestler.

Smoking King: I'm afraid I've reached my limit.

Shinobu: That's just running away.

Smoking King: Shinobu... You've got a ways to go as a racer, but you truly are a champ.

Smoking King: Someday, when we meet again...

Shinobu: Let's go tandem.

Smoking King: I'll go easy on you next time, too. Goodbye, tough girl.

White Sheepman: In the world of real men, the realest of men rise up from nothing.

White Sheepman: You two are like big, sweaty sumos locked up in a big, sweaty sumo hug. Can't wait to see you again.
