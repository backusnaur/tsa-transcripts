# Travis

## Pre-fight dialogue

**Travis:** Are you really THE Johnson?! No, wait... You've got a different name now... Eight Hearts.

**Eight Hearts:** You know my name? Who are you?

**Travis:** A gamer, and a huge Damned fan.

**Eight Hearts:** How many playthroughs?

**Travis:** Just three, but not being able to carry over weapons was always frustrating.

**Eight Hearts:** It's meant to set you back to basics.

**Travis:** Oh I'm not mad at that or anything. I always assumed there were probably memory issues and stuff.

**Travis:** But if it ever gets a new port, I just hope that you're able to carry weapons over to the next playthrough, that's all.

**Eight Hearts:** Yeah, I'll let the right people know.

**Eight Hearts:** Alright... That's enough small talk.

**Travis:** I just can't get over this. It's such an honor to be able to go up against THE Johnson.

**Eight Hearts:** The only one to whom I've ever lost to is Garcia.

**Eight Hearts:** Always has been. Always will be.

**Travis:** Man, you're awesome. But I'm not gonna hold back.

**Travis:** It's time for the legend to sleep.

**Eight Hearts:** I hate the word "legend." You do too, right Travis?

**Travis:** Yup, I can't stand it either. OK Johnson, let's do this!

**Eight Hearts:** I'll take everything you've got. Bring it on, Travis!

## Mid-fight dialogue

**Garcia:** Switch to the next phase, Johnson!

**Eight Hearts:** I hear... Garcia's voice...

**Travis:** I heard it too. That cool-ass voice... He's watching over our battle.

**Eight Hearts:** Garcia, give me power! The power to take down this badass assassin!

## Post-fight dialogue

**Eight Hearts:** I'm sorry, Garcia... For being such a weak partner.

**Garcia:** You're the greatest partner ever.

**Eight Hearts:** Hey, Garcia. Let's continue our journey together. I can't do it alone.

**Garcia:** What's up, Johnson? That's not like you.

**Eight Hearts:** I miss you, Garcia! Let's fire up that Big Boner again!

**Garcia:** That's impossible, Johnson. I've been sent to the 4th dimension. I'm in the deepest depths of prison.

**Eight Hearts:** Where are you?! I'll go save you.

**Garcia:** No! You'll be killed, too. This place is the true Hell.

**Eight Hearts:** Don't give up, Garcia!

**Garcia:** Hey, assassin. Take good care of my partner.

**Travis:** Fuck off, Mr. Legendary Demon Hunter.

**Travis:** I don't need no goddamn partner. You have just one thing to do: Destroying that 4th dimension.

**Eight Hearts:** He's right, Garcia! Someday we'll go on a journey of battle together once again.

**Garcia:** That sounds good... Well, that's enough reading for me. Guess I'll get a bit of exercise.

**Eight Hearts:** You gonna be OK without my gun?

**Garcia:** I'm fine with my bare hands.

**Eight Hearts:** Don't get killed this time.

**Garcia:** I'll never falter again.

**Eight Hearts:** Wait for me, Garcia. I'm coming to find you.

**Eight Hearts:** Finding the door to the 4th dimension will be a piece of cake if I put a bit of work into it!

**Garcia:** Hurry, Johnson! We're gonna go hunt down Fleming's son like a dog.

**Eight Hearts:** Travis Touchdown. The second man to ever beat me. You, too, are a man among men.

**Travis:** I look better in a racing jacker, though.

**Travis:** Tell the demon hunter to wear a goddamn T-shirt underneath.

**Eight Hearts:** He likes showing off. He's proud of his toned bod.

**Garcia:** Hey! Enough with the bullshit.

**Garcia:** Later, assassin. See you again sometime...

**Travis:** Yeah... That'd be fun.

**Garcia:** Goodbye, Travis! If you're ever in a pinch, I'll help you out.

**Travis:** Don't worry. Never needed it, never will.

**Eight Hearts:** Hehehe... The circle has appeared! Now, to the 4th dimension!

**Travis:** Goodbye, Johnson... So... Garcia Hotspur's coming back. One more thing to look forward to.

**White Sheepman:** Nice work.

**White Sheepman:** I was a bit worried about what to do if you actually killed Eight Hearts. Nice one, Travis.

**White Sheepman:** Thanks to you, he's now off to free Garcia, and we just may be seeing a sequel on the horizon.

**White Sheepman:** By the way, Paula has been really into SUP yoga recently, and has been seriously considering moving to Hawaii, apparently.

**White Sheepman:** The world is actually pretty peaceful.

# Badman

## Pre-fight dialogue

**Badman:** Are you... Johnson? No, it's something else now... Eight Hearts, right...?

**Eight Hearts:** You know my name? Who are you?

**Badman:** Just some guy whose head has been filled with the bullshit fantasy of some fucking asshole "Damned" fanboy...

**Eight Hearts:** And how many playthroughs has this "fucking asshole" completed?

**Badman:** Three, apparently. But... he's been bitching about not being able to carry over weapons.

**Eight Hearts:** It's meant to set you back to basics.

**Badman:** I don't think he's pissed off or anything. It seems he understands there must been memory issues or some shit.

**Badman:** But if it ever gets ported, he wants to be able to carry weapons over to the next playthrough, that's all.

**Badman:** Why the fuck do I have to play the goddamn telephone game for you dickheads?!

**Eight Hearts:** Yeah, I'll let the right people know.

**Eight Hearts:** Alright... That's enough small talk.

**Badman:** Looks like it's time to throw down. I got no idea who the hell you are, but I gotta keep moving so I'm gonna have to take your ass down now.

**Eight Hearts:** The only one to whom I've ever lost to is Garcia.

**Eight Hearts:** Always has been. Always will be.

**Badman:** Well look at the big guy with the .900 batting average. I'm gonna cut that down a bit for you.

**Badman:** You've been hiding out here in the underworld too long, Mr. Legend.

**Eight Hearts:** I hate the word "legend." You do, too, right Badman?

**Badman:** I'm just a good ol' outlaw, myself. Let's go, Eight Hearts!

**Eight Hearts:** I'll take everything you've got. Bring it on, Badman!

## Mid-fight dialogue

**Garcia:** Switch to the next phase, Johnson!

**Eight Hearts:** I hear... Garcia's voice...

**Badman:** Voices again? Who the fuck is it this time?

**Eight Hearts:** Garcia, give me power! The power to take down this badass assassin!

## Post-fight dialogue

**Eight Hearts:** I'm sorry, Garcia... For being such a weak partner.

**Garcia:** You're the greatest partner ever.

**Garcia:** No! You'll be killed, too. This place is the true Hell.

**Eight Hearts:** Don't give up, Garcia!

**Garcia:** Hey, assassin. Take good care of my partner.

**Badman:** Fuck off. Everyone and their uncle is trying to get me to do something for them.

**Badman:** Don't ask me for shit. You lovebirds go ahead and do you, and keep me the hell out of it.

**Eight Hearts:** He's right, Garcia! Someday we'll go on a journey of battle together once again.

**Garcia:** That sounds good... Well, that's enough reading for me. Guess I'll get a bit of exercise.

**Eight Hearts:** You gonna be OK without my gun?

**Garcia:** Hurry, Johnson! We're gonna go hunt down Fleming's son like a dog.

**Eight Hearts:** Badman. The second man to ever beat me. You, too, are a man among men.

**Badman:** Except I look way better in a baseball jersey.

**Badman:** I got a message for you guys: "Tell the demon hunter to wear a goddamn t-shirt underneath." You know what he's talking about?

**Eight Hearts:** He likes showing off. He's proud of his toned bod.

**Garcia:** Hey! Enough with the bullshit.

**Garcia:** Later, assassin. See you again sometime...

**Badman:** Yeah... If we get the chance.

**Garcia:** Goodbye, Badman! If you're ever in a pinch, I'll help you out.

**Badman:** Don't worry about me. I've never really been much of a team player anyway.

**Eight Hearts:** Hehehe... The circle has appeared! Now, to the 4th dimension!

**Badman:** Goodbye, Eight Hearts. I guess your days of holing up in the demon world are done, huh? Take care in the 4th dimension.

**White Sheepman:** Nice work.

**White Sheepman:** I was a bit worried about what to do if you actually killed Eight Hearts. Nice one, Badman.

**White Sheepman:** Thanks to you, he's now off to free Garcia, and we just may be seeing a sequel on the horizon.

**White Sheepman:** By the way, Paula has been really into SUP yoga recently, and has been seriously considering moving to Hawaii, apparently.

# Shinobu

## Pre-fight dialogue

**Shinobu:** So you're Eight Hearts...

**Eight Hearts:** You know my name? Who are you?

**Shinobu:** My master is a fan of your game.

**Eight Hearts:** And how many playthroughs has this "master" completed?

**Shinobu:** I think he said it was like five... He was bitching and whining the whole time, though.

**Eight Hearts:** It's meant to set you back to basics.

**Shinobu:** Yeah, I have no idea what you're talking about... Be he seemed pretty pissed off.

**Eight Hearts:** Yeah, I'll let the right people know.

**Eight Hearts:** Alright... That's enough small talk.

**Shinobu:** Come at me whenever you're ready. I know nothing about video games, so not much point in talking anyway.

**Eight Hearts:** The only one to whom I've ever lost to is Garcia.

**Eight Hearts:** Always has been. Always will be.

**Shinobu:** So you're some kind of legend, huh?

**Eight Hearts:** I hate the word "legend."

**Eight Hearts:** As do you, right, Shinobu?

**Shinobu:** Well, I still have a future, so... It's about 50 years too soon to be called a "legend."

**Eight Hearts:** Now, give me everything you've got. Come, Shinobu!

## Mid-fight dialogue

**Garcia:** Switch to the next phase, Johnson!

**Eight Hearts:** I hear... Garcia's voice...

**Shinobu:** I hear something, too... Barely...

**Eight Hearts:** Garcia, give me power! The power to take down this badass assassin!

## Post-fight dialogue

**Eight Hearts:** Don't give up, Garcia!

**Garcia:** Hey, assassin. Take good care of my partner.

**Shinobu:** Nope nope nope nope NOPE... I want nothing to do with this stuff.

**Eight Hearts:** She's right, Garcia! Someday we'll go on a journey of battle together once again.

**Garcia:** That sounds good... Well, that's enough reading for me. Guess I'll get a bit of exercise.

**Eight Hearts:** You gonna be OK without my gun?

**Garcia:** Hurry, Johnson! We're gonna go hunt down Fleming's son like a dog.

**Eight Hearts:** Only you and one other have ever defeated me. And you're both awesome.

**Shinobu:** That dude wasn't wearing a shirt...

**Eight Hearts:** He likes showing off. He's proud of his toned bod.

**Garcia:** Hey! Enough with the bullshit.

**Garcia:** Later, assassin. See you again sometime...

**Shinobu:** I mean, probably not, but yeah, sure...

**Garcia:** Goodbye, Shinobu! If you're ever in trouble, I've got your back.

**Shinobu:** Yeah please don't bother...

**Eight Hearts:** Hehehe... The circle has appeared! Now, to the 4th dimension!

**Shinobu:** He went off into the 4th dimension... And I heard Garcia's voice, too.

**White Sheepman:** Nice work.

**White Sheepman:** I was a bit worried about what to do if you actually killed Eight Hearts, but good ol' Shinobu came through.

**White Sheepman:** Thanks to you, he's now off to free Garcia, and we just may be seeing a sequel on the horizon.

**White Sheepman:** By the way, Paula has been really into SUP yoga recently, and has been seriously considering moving to Hawaii, apparently.
