# Travis

## Pre-fight dialogue

**Electro Triple Star:** Visitor... I've been waiting.

**Electro Triple Star:** My name is Electro Triple Star. The main character of the amazing hit game, Electric Thunder Tiger.

**Travis:** Triple Star! I know you! I played that for days at the arcade.

**Travis:** The industrial monster designs were badass, and your Big Cannon was even more awesome!

**Electro Triple Star:** I see...

**Travis:** You're a video game superstar! And my hero!

**Electro Triple Star:** Visitor... Why do we fight?

**Travis:** Blood.

**Electro Triple Star:** The visitor fights for bloodthirst. Only for that...

**Travis:** It just gets my blood rushing. You feel it too, right?

**Electro Triple Star:** Electricity is my blood. Your arrival gets my electricity rushing. It's a bad omen.

**Travis:** Blood and electricity, huh?

**Electro Triple Star:** Do you have a family?

**Travis:** Yeah.

**Electro Triple Star:** Are they important to you?

**Travis:** How many answers are there to that question? What about you?

**Electro Triple Star:** I was unable to protect my beloved family.

**Electro Triple Star:** Fighting me... Will result in making your family grieve.

**Travis:** Don't worry. I'll send you on your way back to your family.

**Electro Triple Star:** Maybe it's because this is an action game... But the only stage prepared for us is one on which to fight.

**Travis:** What, you wanna do a BBQ together? Me, I'll pass...

**Electro Triple Star:** You are right. Alright then, draw your sword.

**Travis:** OK, and you power up.

**Travis:** Once this text disappears, we do this!

## Mid-fight dialogue 1

**Electro Triple Star:** Visitor, do you live up to your name?

**Electro Triple Star:** Visitor... You're good.

**Electro Triple Star:** You're wasting your life as an assassin. Live in the world of video games.

**Travis:** Games are supposed to be played. Not lived.

**Electro Triple Star:** I want you to be in my next game. I'll text you later. Contact me anytime if you like.

**Travis:** Whatever - anyway, hurry up and change phase. You're not telling me this is the end, right?

**Electro Triple Star:** As you wish. Now for Phase 2!

**Travis:** Seriously...? This dude is batshit crazy. I like it, Triple Star!

**Electro Triple Star:** I call upon electricity with body and soul.

**Electro Triple Star:** Electronic Shooting Star!

## Mid-fight dialogue 2

**Electro Triple Star:** Gah!

**Electro Triple Star:** That's a deep break.

**Travis:** That felt damn good.

**Electro Triple Star:** This isn't over yet, Travis!

**Travis:** No way...

**Electro Triple Star:** Tonight I am especially strong.

**Travis:** Bitchin'!

**Electro Triple Star:** Visitor, defeat me and take this world in your hands.

## Post-fight dialogue

**Electro Triple Star:** Guaaaaaah!

**Electro Triple Star:** To become legend is painful...

**Electro Triple Star:** Visitor, this is true pain. I now know pain.

**Travis:** The pain only the defeated know.

**Electro Triple Star:** You are past redemption, visitor.

**Electro Triple Star:** Will this world be saved? Or destroyed? Do with it as you like.

**Travis:** I don't need to be told. I'll do as I like anyway.

**Electro Triple Star:** I thank you. I was uncomfortable here.

**Electro Triple Star:** Maybe I was waiting for your arrival. I wish we could've met somewhere else.

**Travis:** Farewell, my hero.

**White Sheepman:** Goodbye, Triple Star. This world salutes you.

**White Sheepman:** You gave us a bit of peace and order. The next Death Driver shall take on the deletion of the destroyer.

**Travis:** You calling me a "destroyer"? I could get used to it, but it really hate those stereotypical anti-hero types.

**White Sheepman:** You've cleared the game.

# Badman

## Pre-fight dialogue

**Electro Triple Star:** Can I as you something, visitor?

**Badman:** What?

**Electro Triple Star:** Why do we fight?

**Badman:** We have conflicting interests. You got another reason?

**Electro Triple Star:** And what is your interest?

**Badman:** Blood.

**Electro Triple Star:** The visitor fights for bloodthirst. Only for that...

**Badman:** It just gets my blood rushing. You saying you're different?

**Electro Triple Star:** Electricity is my blood. Your arrival gets my electricity rushing. It's a bad omen.

**Badman:** Blood and electricity, huh? Yup, sounds pretty conflicting to me.

**Electro Triple Star:** Do you have a family?

**Badman:** Used to.

**Electro Triple Star:** Are they important to you?

**Badman:** How many fucking answers are there to that question, huh? How about yourself?

**Electro Triple Star:** I was unable to protect my beloved family.

**Electro Triple Star:** Fighting me... Will result in making your family grieve.

**Badman:** What's the point of all this bullshit? Let's just hurry up and kill each other!

**Electro Triple Star:** Maybe it's because this is an action game... But the only stage prepared for us is one on which to fight.

**Badman:** There's plenty of time to sit on the bench, talking shit and fading away in the afterlife.

**Electro Triple Star:** I agree. Alright, draw your bat.

**Badman:** OK, and you power up.

**Badman:** Once this text disappears, we play ball.

# Shinobu

## Pre-fight dialogue

**Electro Triple Star:** Can I as you something, visitor?

**Shinobu:** What is it?

**Electro Triple Star:** Why do we fight?

**Shinobu:** I don't like video games.

**Shinobu:** My ex-boyfriend was a gamer, and my master is a gamer. Gamers never listen when you're talking, and they don't go on dates.

**Shinobu:** Gamers are a girl's natural enemy.

**Electro Triple Star:** And what is your interest?

**Shinobu:** Interest...? I don't remember saying anything about that...

**Electro Triple Star:** The visitor fights for bloodthirst. Only for that...

**Shinobu:** This katana is growing restless in its thirst for blood.

**Electro Triple Star:** Electricity is my blood. Your arrival gets my electricity rushing. It's a bad omen.

**Shinobu:** Electricity and blood... I have no idea what you're talking about...

**Electro Triple Star:** Do you have a family?

**Shinobu:** Seriously, what the hell are you talking about...?

**Electro Triple Star:** Are they important to you?

**Shinobu:** For reals now, NFI what you're on about...

**Electro Triple Star:** I was unable to protect my beloved family.

**Electro Triple Star:** Fighting me... Will result in making your family grieve.

**Shinobu:** I think you should be worrying about yourself before you start worrying about other people.

**Electro Triple Star:** Maybe it's because this is an action game... But the only stage prepared for us is one on which to fight.

**Shinobu:** As long as I live, the battle, too, lives on... Am I wrong?

**Electro Triple Star:** I agree. Alright, draw your katana.

**Shinobu:** Come at me whenever you're ready. My sword is fast, you know.

**Shinobu:** Faster than electricity, even.

**Shinobu:** If you insist...

**Electro Triple Star:** I thank you. I was uncomfortable here.

**Electro Triple Star:** Maybe I was waiting for your arrival. I wish we could've met somewhere else.

**Shinobu:** Yeah, let's, uh... never meet in the real world.

**White Sheepman:** Goodbye, Triple Star. This world salutes you.

**White Sheepman:** You gave us a bit of peace and order. The next Death Driver shall take on the deletion of the destroyer.

**Shinobu:** Whatever, let them go ahead and delete it...

**Electro Triple Star:** And what is your interest?

**Bad Girl:** Also killing.

**Electro Triple Star:** The visitor fights for bloodthirst. Only for that...

**Bad Girl:** Bloodthirst, huh? Well no shit, Sherlock! I'm gonna make it rain blood up in here!

**Electro Triple Star:** Electricity is my blood. Your arrival gets my electricity rushing. It's a bad omen.

**Bad Girl:** I don't give a shit about your electricity or whatever! You're about to get soaked in blood!

**Electro Triple Star:** Maybe it's because this is an action game... But the only stage prepared for us is one on which to fight.

**Bad Girl:** If it's a stage for murder, I'm totally down. Now let's hurry up and kill each other!

**Electro Triple Star:** I agree. Alright, draw your bat.
