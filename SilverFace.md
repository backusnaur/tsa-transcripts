# Travis

## Pre-fight dialogue

Travis: So you're the all-time ultimate undefeated champion, Silver Face!

Travis: I'm Travis Touchdown. I'm a passing assassin, and I'm also known as king of the gamers.

Travis: And I'm here to kick your ass!

Silver Face: OK, look... Don't bother with the grandstanding. I'm just not in the mood right now.

Silver Face: I think you may be misunderstanding, but this Killer Marathon game... It's pinball, you know?

Silver Face: You've probably picked up on this, but this game is made from the settings and illustrations of a pinball table...

Silver Face: And realistically, it wouldn't really be possible to run a marathon while killing off a bunch of people, would it?

Silver Face: What kind of organization would sign off on something like that? This is some made-up fantasy stuff.

Travis: Actually I did notice that, but you've never killed anyone before, have you?

Silver Face: In an experiment in science class, I fainted while dissecting a frog. I totally fainted, in front of all the girls.

Travis: That sounds like some real trauma.

Silver Face: Anyway, yeah, no... Killing, punching, whatever... I literally can't even.

Silver Face: I hate exercising.

Silver Face: I played wind instruments in band at school, and had a shitty school life. I especially can't stand dudebro killer types like yourself.

Travis: But you can't escape the fight. You're gonna have to fight me.

Silver Face: So that's how it's gonna be, huh...? Are you trying to rile up my instincts?

Silver Face: The true face of my instincts... What lies behind it... My settings...

Silver Face: What the hell are "settings" anyway?

Travis: "Settings" are basically proof of your existence. The mechanism that makes your ego.

Silver Face: My ego...

Silver Face: Instinctually enjoying murder, and creating records of murder as a sport... That's Silver Face.

Silver Face: My Infinite Death Punch is going to end you.

Travis: Nice! That's what I've been waiting for!

Silver Face: Tonight, my fist is especially angry. It's pissed about having been relegated to the very end.

Travis: So you're threatening me all of a sudden, marathon monkey?

Silver Face: I mean, I guess so... It's kinda cool to be able to avoid the DLC on this platform and basically become the "last boss," I guess.

Travis: Right? If you think about it, it pretty much means you're the main character, you know?

Silver Face: Get the fuck outta here! When it all comes down to it, everyone is just here for Bad Girl, anyway.

Travis: You're overthinking this shit, dude.

Silver Face: It's just not the same! I object! I'm going on strike!

Silver Face: I'm gonna kill you!

Travis: That's some nice bloodlust for a guy composed of just settings and an illustration.

Silver Face: Settings make the man, the ego takes hold, and the illustration becomes reality.

Silver Face: Therefore I will become the final champion of reality.

Travis: Let's do this!

## Mid-fight dialogue 1

Silver Face: More more more more!

Travis: Come on, Silver Face! Are you fucking kidding me?!

Travis: Unload all that frustration on me!

Silver Face: Oh I will indeed!

## Mid-fight dialogue 2

Silver Face: More more more more more MORE! Not enough STIMULATION!

Travis: The marathon isn't over yet.

Silver Face: The real marathon starts now! Think you can handle more battle?

Travis: Show me what a last boss can really do!

## Post-fight dialogue

Silver Face: I've worked up a good sweat.

Travis: Running with you is something else. Blood suits this marathon more than sweat.

Silver Face: With my blood flowing like this, that which was fuzzy has become clear.

Silver Face: Why did I become Silver Face? Why was I born to a world of pinball?

Travis: So what's become clear, exactly?

Silver Face: We are updated, reformed, we evolve, synthesize, awaken, combine...

Silver Face: We run further on the path of evolution, to the bright future that's sure to lie ahead.

Travis: Can you trust that future?

Silver Face: Who knows...? But this world is full of things that you simply can't know without trying to run the path.

Travis: Yeah, you and I may be on different paths, but I'll give mine a run. Our paths may cross again somewhere.

Silver Face: When that happens...

Travis: Wanna shed some more blood?

Silver Face: Let's stick to sweat next time.

Travis: I can do that.

Silver Face: Travis Touchdown, I'm going to hurry on ahead. The next goal awaits.

Travis: Goodbye, Marathon King.

# Badman

## Pre-fight dialogue

Badman: So you're the badass "marathon man" or whatever with the shiny face, huh?

Badman: I'm Shigekix "Badman" Birkin.

Badman: I'm a passing niche assassin, and I used to be the eternally-soused pretty boy of baseball.

Badman: So I gotta knock your ass outta the park now, huh?

Silver Face: OK, look... Don't bother with the grandstanding. I'm just not in the mood right now.

Silver Face: I think you may be misunderstanding, but this Killer Marathon game... It's pinball, you know?

Silver Face: You've probably picked up on this, but this game is made from the settings and illustrations of a pinball table...

Silver Face: And realistically, it wouldn't really be possible to run a marathon while killing off a bunch of people, would it?

Silver Face: What sort of organization would sign off on something like that? This is some made-up fantasy stuff.

Badman: Yeah, that's what I thought. You've clearly never killed nobody before.

Silver Face: In an experiment in science class, I fainted while dissecting a frog. I totally fainted, in front of all the girls.

Badman: I bet the girls were just as thrilled.

Silver Face: Anyway, yeah, no... Killing, punching, whatever... I literally can't even.

Silver Face: I hate exercising.

Silver Face: I played wind instruments in band at school, and had a shitty school life. I especially can't stand dudebro killer types like yourself.

Badman: You're not getting outta this with all that reminisching bullshit. We're here to fight; we're gonna fight.

Silver Face: So that's how it's gonna be, huh...? Are you trying to rile up my instincts?

Silver Face: The true face of my instincts... What lies behind it... My settings...

Silver Face: What the hell are "settings" anyway?

Badman: "Settings"? Well, that's your very own raison d'être right there, isn't it?

Badman: An ego-producing mechanism.

Silver Face: My ego...

Silver Face: Instinctually enjoying murder, and creating records of murder as a sport... That's Silver Face.

Silver Face: My Infinite Death Punch is going to end you.

Badman: Hey now. So you've finally come around, huh?

Silver Face: Tonight, my fist is especially angry. It's pissed about having been relegated to the very end.

Badman: The fuck...? Now you're gonna start bitching?

Badman: But doesn't coming last just prove what a big deal you are?

Silver Face: I mean, I guess so... It's kinda cool to be able to avoid the DLC on this platform and basically become the "last boss," I guess.

Badman: Right?

Badman: Hey, my ADV part was stuck in DLC too, you know. You just gotta stay positive.

Silver Face: Get the fuck outta here! When it all comes down to it, everyone is just here for Bad Girl, anyway.

Badman: So she really is that popular, huh? I can see how you'd get jealous.

Silver Face: It's just not the same! I object! I'm going on strike!

Silver Face: I'm gonna kill you!

Badman: For some reason, it seems like the ol' bloodlust has started boiling.

Silver Face: Settings make the man, the ego takes hold, and the illustration becomes reality.

Silver Face: Therefore I will become the final champion of reality.

Badman: That's just great. So you're finally ready to do this?

Badman: Let's do it!

## Mid-fight dialogue 1

Silver Face: More more more more!

Badman: C'mon, bring it on!

Badman: I know you can do better than that. Gimme all your hatred and rage!

## Mid-fight dialogue 2

Silver Face: More more more more more MORE! Not enough STIMULATION!

Badman: Nice, you're getting there.

Silver Face: The real marathon starts now! Think you can handle more battle?

Badman: Hell yeah. I'm gonna show you that a middle-aged guy really gets going when he's got two strikes and bases are loaded.

## Post-fight dialogue

Silver Face: I've worked up a good sweat.

Badman: Sweat, huh...? Looks like some other kinda red bodily fluid to me.

Silver Face: With my blood flowing like this, that which was fuzzy has become clear.

Silver Face: Why did I become Silver Face? Why was I born to a world of pinball?

Badman: So what's clear now?

Silver Face: We are updated, reformed, we evolve, synthesize, awaken, combine...

Silver Face: We run further on the path of evolution, to the bright future that's sure to lie ahead.

Badman: Can you really trust that future?

Silver Face: Who knows...? But this world is full of things that you simply can't know without trying to run the path.

Badman: Yeah, you're right. In that case, I'm gonna run, too. Who knows, we might run into each other again someday.

Silver Face: When that happens...

Badman: Wanna draw some more blood?

Silver Face: Let's stick to sweat next time.

Badman: Yeah, let's do that.

Silver Face: Badman, I'm going to hurry on ahead. The next goal awaits.

Badman: Adios, Marathon Man.

# Shinobu

## Pre-fight dialogue

Shinobu: So you're Silver Face... You're going down with lightning speed!

Silver Face: OK, look... Don't bother with the grandstanding. I'm just not in the mood right now.

Silver Face: I think you may be misunderstanding, but this Killer Marathon game... It's pinball, you know?

Silver Face: You've probably picked up on this, but this game is made from the settings and illustrations of a pinball table...

Silver Face: And realistically, it wouldn't really be possible to run a marathon while killing off a bunch of people, would it?

Silver Face: What sort of organization would sign off on something like that? This is some made-up fantasy stuff.

Shinobu: Are these really the words of a champion killer?

Silver Face: Nope. All that killing stuff is obviously fake.

Silver Face: Murdering people while running a marathon? What kind of drunk-ass degenerate would even come up with that idea?

Silver Face: You can't believe everything you see, you know.

Shinobu: I'm not that naïve, you know. But there's no need to disparage your very existence like that, is there?

Silver Face: Do you say that with a full understanding of your own true self?

Shinobu: That depends on what exactly you mean...

Silver Face: I mean your basic foundation. Who are you?

Shinobu: Shinobu Jacobs...

Shinobu: My grandpa is Assistant Instructor of Shippu-Kokuren-ryu Assassination, Noboru Jacobs.

Shinobu: My father is...

Silver Face: You don't know, do you? That's because you're not real.

Shinobu: My...

Shinobu: My father...

Silver Face: Doesn't exist.

Shinobu: My father...

Shinobu: I... I don't know...

Silver Face: That's right.

Shinobu: What does this mean?

Silver Face: You were created... You were created via settings, and your "parents" are simply settings.

Shinobu: Settings...?

Silver Face: Yeah - you yourself are simply made up of settings. You don't actually exist in this world.

Silver Face: You and I, we're the same, you know.

Silver Face: Come over to this side... And remain here in the world of the Death Drive.

Silver Face: This is a peaceful place, a place of calm and quiet.

Silver Face: A place where nothing ever happens. That is the truest form of peace.

Shinobu: Is that even a world that I could live in?

Silver Face: Of course it is! You've seen too much of the vulgar, violent world. You've come to view peace as the enemy!

Silver Face: But you've actually been yearning for peace all along.

Shinobu: I've dreamt about a peaceful world... Somewhere deep down inside, I've been longing for peace and quiet...

Shinobu: I want to cry.

Silver Face: It's OK, go ahead and cry. Let the tears flow freely.

Travis: Don't let him confuse you! It's all a mind trick.

Travis: Your father is my own mentor, the great Tim Jacobs! Don't forget your daddy's name!

Shinobu: You tricked me... Pretty dirty for a so-called "champ." Now you can shut up and die.

Silver Face: Shit! You got me.

Silver Face: In that case, time for my last resort... I'll destroy you with my Speed Launcher Punch!

Shinobu: Dammit!

## Mid-fight dialogue 1

Silver Face: More more more more!

Shinobu: How soft and weak... Silver Face, is that all you've got?

Silver Face: I've got plenty more!

## Mid-fight dialogue 2

Silver Face: More more more more more MORE! Not enough STIMULATION!

Shinobu: The marathon continues... From here to eternity.

Silver Face: The real marathon starts now! Think you can handle more battle?

Shinobu: That's more like it, champ. Come on!

## Post-fight dialogue

Silver Face: I've worked up a good sweat.

Shinobu: That's not sweat. That's your own blood...

Silver Face: With my blood flowing like this, that which was fuzzy has become clear.

Silver Face: Why did I become Silver Face? Why was I born to a world of pinball?

Shinobu: ...?

Silver Face: We are updated, reformed, we evolve, synthesize, awaken, combine...

Silver Face: We run further on the path of evolution, to the bright future that's sure to lie ahead.

Shinobu: Can you guarantee that future?

Silver Face: Who knows...? But this world is full of things that you simply can't know without trying to run the path.

Shinobu: Will you continue to run?

Silver Face: Shinobu Jacobs, I'm going to hurry on ahead. The next goal awaits.

Shinobu: Goodbye, Marathon King.

## Pre-fight dialogue

Bad Girl: Kill kill KILL KILL KILLLLLL!

Silver Face: What are you gonna do...? Keep fighting?

Bad Girl: I haven't seen your blood yet. So I'm gonna kill you! It's that simple!

Silver Face: That would be pointless. I've already died once, you know.

Silver Face: You still insist on "seeing my blood"? That's just crazy talk.

Bad Girl: "Crazy"?

Bad Girl: Oh hell yeah. You trying to make me fucking blush?!

Silver Face: The old DLC grudge... That grudge is about to get paid off.

Silver Face: Fuck right off with that garbage! You fucking punk! I'll scratch your goddamn eyeballs out!

Bad Girl: What's wrong, loser? Getting all scary out of nowhere.

Bad Girl: Quit your whining and bitching and HIT ME!

Bad Girl: C'mon! Hit me! I'll LET YOU hit me!

Bad Girl: You fucking asshole!

Silver Face: Dark Galaxy Punch!

Bad Girl: You think you can hit me with that?! You're dealing with #1 over here! You can't hit me with that slow-ass garbage!

Bad Girl: Bring it PROPERLY!

Silver Face: Accelerator Punch!

Bad Girl: Ouch...

Bad Girl: The fuck are you doing...?

Bad Girl: You HIT me.

Bad Girl: I'm SO gonna kill you...

Silver Face: Shinkansen Punch!

Bad Girl: Oh hell yeah...

Bad Girl: YES! That was a nice one, I'll give you that, Silver Face!

Silver Face: Nobody can overcome me now!

Silver Face: You fucking punk! You're gonna DIE!

Silver Face: Experience a TRUE last boss!

Bad Girl: So you're the "last boss," huh?

Bad Girl: This bat doesn't exactly agree, but I'll kill you nice and special anyway!

## Mid-fight dialogue 1

Silver Face: More more more more!

Bad Girl: I need more KILL! Gimme MORE!

Silver Face: Oh I will indeed!

Silver Face: More more more more more MORE! Not enough STIMULATION!

## Post-fight dialogue

Silver Face: I've worked up a good sweat.

Bad Girl: That's blood, dickweed.

Silver Face: With my blood flowing like this, that which was fuzzy has become clear.

Silver Face: Why did I become Silver Face? Why was I born to a world of pinball?

Bad Girl: Why do I give a shit...?

Silver Face: We are updated, reformed, we evolve, synthesize, awaken, combine...

Silver Face: We run further on the path of evolution, to the bright future that's sure to lie ahead.

Bad Girl: I so don't care. Is that even what you want?

Silver Face: Who knows...? But this world is full of things that you simply can't know without trying to run the path.

Bad Girl: Is this gonna get longer?

Silver Face: Let's do battle again someday.

Bad Girl: Sure, if I feel like it.

Silver Face: Bad Girl, will you do me a favor?

Bad Girl: I can't promise nothing, but I'll hear it out.

Silver Face: Don't forget me.

Bad Girl: Huh? The fuck is that...?

Silver Face: As long as I remain in your memory, I can exist in a non-fabricated place.

Bad Girl: Yeah... That's all super complicated and I got no idea what that means.

Bad Girl: But I'm not gonna forget our fight.

Silver Face: Thank you, Bad Girl. I'm going to hurry on ahead.

Silver Face: The next goal awaits.

Bad Girl: See ya, Marathon Dickhead...
