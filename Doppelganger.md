# Travis

## Pre-fight dialogue

Doppelganger: My name is Doppelganger Patrick Granada Jr.

Doppelganger: I am a professional killer. Why would you get in my way?

Travis: A killer? You're just a crazy-ass murderer...

Travis: This game is bullshit. The developer really sucks.

Doppelganger: She's a genius.

Doppelganger: I gave birth to her and she gave birth to me. A perfect cycle. A true succession.

Travis: You're like, really fucked up, huh?

Travis: But whatever. Sometimes you just gotta deal with weirdos like this, I guess.

Doppelganger: Mwahahahaha! You make me laugh.

Doppelganger: You think an assassin can kill a killer? See for yourself how different we are.

Travis: Yeah, I guess we are pretty different. I just noticed.

Travis: A dude who kills by instinct, and a psycho who kills for work. Let's see who's the strongest!

Doppelganger: Here's my Doppelganger technique. One hit, and you're dead.

Travis: Perfect. I've been wanting some excitement.

Doppelganger: I can hear the sound...

Doppelganger: The sound of blood coursing through your veins. Now, it's time to kill!

Travis: I'm gonna reset your very existence!

## Mid-fight dialogue 1

Doppelganger: Doppelganger 2!

Travis: Come on, bring it! Bring on Phase 2!

Doppelganger: Change! Doppel 2!

## Mid-fight dialogue 2

Doppelganger: Doppelganger 3!

Travis: Your final form, huh? What're you gonna do? Mutate and get real big?

Doppelganger: That was proposed, but it got scrapped for spec reasons.

Travis: Huh? What the hell does that mean...?

Doppelganger: Don't worry about it. I was just thinking out loud.

Doppelganger: Change! Doppel 3!

## Post-fight dialogue

Doppelganger: You managed to defeat me... So this is what an assassin is. This is the truth.

Doppelganger: It's now clear that you're just like me.

Travis: I'm nothing like you. You're just greedy. More greedy than anyone when it comes to killing.

Travis: But you lack something crucial: Human emotion.

Doppelganger: That's not true, assassin. I am full of joy and happiness.

Travis: Having joy without sorrow means you're just an empty specter.

Doppelganger: Sorrow? What?

Travis: Go wander Hell for awhile, specter. Then you'll know sorrow and pain.

Doppelganger: Hell...?

Doppelganger: No no NO! Mama mama mama mama mama MAMA MAMA MAMA MAMA MAMA

Doppelganger: Help me...

Travis: You're no longer even human... Just a demon.

Doppelganger: Hehehehehehehehehehehe HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I'LL KILL YOU...

White Sheepman: Doppelganger had become less than human. I think he would have been satisfied being beaten by you.

White Sheepman: He's still at large in the real world, though. I guess I need to be careful.

# Badman

## Pre-fight dialogue

Doppelganger: My name is Doppelganger Patrick Granada Jr.

Doppelganger: I am a professional killer. Why would you get in my way?

Badman: Professional killer? What's the difference between that and a serial killer, or an assassin, or a regular-ass murderer, huh?

Badman: Anyway, this game is bullshit. The developer really sucks.

Doppelganger: She's a genius.

Doppelganger: I gave birth to her and she gave birth to me. A perfect cycle. A true succession.

Badman: At least it's easy to tell that you're crazier than shit.

Badman: Anyway, whatever. It's just that much easier to kill you.

Doppelganger: Mwahahahaha! You make me laugh.

Doppelganger: You think an assassin can kill a killer? See for yourself how different we are.

Badman: How different we are, huh? So this is like one of those MMA fights, huh?

Badman: The ones with the "soft" and "hard" styles... OK, let's do this and see just who gets killed after all.

Doppelganger: Here's my Doppelganger technique. One hit, and you're dead.

Badman: Bring it! I've always been good at dodging bean balls.

Doppelganger: I can hear the sound...

Doppelganger: The sound of blood coursing through your veins. Now, it's time to kill!

Badman: You mean it's time to get killed. I'm ready to go, come at me anytime.

## Mid-fight dialogue 1

## Post-fight dialogue

Doppelganger: You managed to defeat me... So this is what an assassin is. This is the truth.

Doppelganger: It's now clear that you're just like me.

Badman: You're just greedy. You've got a bigger boner for killing than anyone else I've ever seen.

Badman: But you're short on something crucial: Human emotion.

Doppelganger: That's not true, assassin. I am full of joy and happiness.

Badman: Having joy without sorrow means you're just an empty specter.

Doppelganger: Sorrow? What?

Badman: Spend some time sightseeing in Hell. You'll figure it out. All the sorrow and pain will fill that hole real nicely.

Doppelganger: Hell...?

Doppelganger: No no NO! Mama mama mama mama mama MAMA MAMA MAMA MAMA MAMA

Doppelganger: Help me...

Badman: You're not even human anymore... Just a demon.

Doppelganger: Hehehehehehehehehehehe HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I'LL KILL YOU...

White Sheepman: Doppelganger had become less than human. I think he would have been satisfied being beaten by you.

White Sheepman: He's still at large in the real world, though. I guess I need to be careful.

## Pre-fight dialogue

Doppelganger: My name is Doppelganger Patrick Granada Jr.

Doppelganger: I am a professional killer. Why would you get in my way?

Shinobu: I'm not here to get in your way. I'm here to deal out punishment. That's all.

Shinobu: I'm going to rid her of her nightmare.

Doppelganger: She's a genius.

Doppelganger: I gave birth to her and she gave birth to me. A perfect cycle. A true succession.

Shinobu: Your little introductory speech was nice.

Shinobu: But how are your actual skills?

Doppelganger: Mwahahahaha! You make me laugh.

Doppelganger: You think an assassin can kill a killer? See for yourself how different we are.

Shinobu: Aaand I have no idea what THIS guy's talking about now, either.

Doppelganger: Here's my Doppelganger technique. One hit, and you're dead.

Shinobu: You just keep talking, don't you...?

Doppelganger: I can hear the sound...

Doppelganger: The sound of blood coursing through your veins. Now, it's time to kill!

Shinobu: Yeah, great, anytime now...

## Mid-fight dialogue 2

Doppelganger: Doppelganger 3!

Shinobu: I was expecting that, too! Go ahead, transform into a big-ass robot, see how surprised I am...

Doppelganger: That was proposed, but it got scrapped for spec reasons.

Shinobu: Oh god, seriously...?

Doppelganger: Don't worry about it. I was just thinking out loud.

Doppelganger: It's now clear that you're just like me.

Shinobu: Oh you can fuck right off with that... Don't try to equate me with yourself.

Shinobu: Unlike you, I have actual human emotions.

Doppelganger: That's not true, assassin. I am full of joy and happiness.

Shinobu: No... I can see sorrow in your eyes.

Doppelganger: Sorrow? What?

Shinobu: Go to Hell...

Doppelganger: Hell...?

Doppelganger: No no NO! Mama mama mama mama mama MAMA MAMA MAMA MAMA MAMA

Doppelganger: Help me...

Shinobu: You're no longer human... You've been reduced to a simple savage.

Doppelganger: Hehehehehehehehehehehe HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I'LL KILL YOU...

White Sheepman: Doppelganger had become less than human. I think he would have been satisfied being beaten by you.

White Sheepman: He's still at large in the real world, though. I guess I need to be careful.

## Pre-fight dialogue

Doppelganger: My name is Doppelganger Patrick Granada Jr.

Doppelganger: I am a professional killer. Why would you get in my way?

Bad Girl: I'm gonna kill every little bit of you. This whole game is about five seconds away from full-on genocide!

Doppelganger: She's a genius.

Doppelganger: I gave birth to her and she gave birth to me. A perfect cycle. A true succession.
